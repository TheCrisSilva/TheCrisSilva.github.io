Building something new, especially a first-of-its-kind facility, is never easy. I experienced this firsthand when I embarked on a journey to establish the first community bio lab in Sri Lanka. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in the BioSummit virtually. This event was a turning point in my life, as I connected with the co-founder of Dreamspace Academy, the only other Sri Lankan at the conference. Together, we envisioned a space where community-driven biotechnology could thrive. A few months later, I moved to Batticaloa, a town in eastern Sri Lanka, to kickstart this groundbreaking initiative.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was acquiring lab equipment and reagents amid the COVID-19 restrictions and an economic crisis that severely limited foreign currency transactions. Despite these hurdles, we managed to secure the necessary supplies, albeit with significant delays. The situation improved considerably with the arrival of Alessandro from Top Lab Berlin, who generously volunteered to stay with us for five weeks. His expertise was invaluable; he trained our team, including myself, in lab management and project initiation, setting a solid foundation for the lab's future.

As we progressed, we gradually expanded our team, conducted workshops, and fully utilized the lab during the Digital Naturalism Conference. This event brought together artists and researchers worldwide, providing a fertile ground for innovative projects. Notably, we developed prototypes of mycelium materials and shared our knowledge through workshops. Before leaving Batticaloa, I ensured that local community members were well-trained to continue the lab's work.

The establishment of the first community bio lab in Sri Lanka has created a crucial platform for future innovators in Batticaloa to embark on their biotech journeys. Reflecting on my two years there, I am proud to have pioneered community biotechnology in Sri Lanka and contributed to my country's scientific and educational landscape.

This experience has been both challenging and rewarding, solidifying my belief in the transformative power of community-driven innovation. If you're interested in setting up your own lab or exploring biotech projects, feel free to reach out. I would be happy to share insights and tips based on my experiences.
